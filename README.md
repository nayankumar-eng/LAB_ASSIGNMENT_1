Student Record Management System

Object-Oriented Concepts Used
Classes & Objects: Student class models student records.

Inheritance: Student extends Person to reuse name property.

Encapsulation: Data fields stored inside class with methods to modify them.

Constructors: Default and parameterized constructors initialize objects.

Methods Implemented
inputDetails(): Takes user input using Scanner.

displayDetails(): Prints student details.

calculateGrade(): Computes grade based on marks.

Arrays / Collections
ArrayList is used to store multiple student objects dynamically.

Control Structures
Loops for menu repetition.

Conditionals (if-else) to calculate grade and handle menu choices.

Menu-Driven Program
Provides 3 options: add student, display students, exit.

Ensures smooth user interaction using Scanner.

Data Validation (Basic)
Marks are entered as double; grade assigned based on ranges.
